Project: 1

Mini-Games Website:

Objective:
Design a web portal where users can select and play games. The games they can pick from are the ones you have built earlier in the course: Number Guesser, Rock Paper Scissors, Hangman, Blackjack, and Tic Tac Toe. Each team member in the group will be responsible for implementing the web page for one of the games, and the group as a whole will be responsible for the rest of the website. 
Project teams are listed here
Links to an external site.

Notes:
	◦ The number of games required on the website depends on the number of team members in your group (3 or 4). 
	◦ Your team must utilize GitHub features for collaboration throughout the project.
	◦ The descriptions below detail the minimum requirements for the website. We highly encourage you to get creative and expand on it to include additional features as this will be a good project to showcase on your projects portfolio! 
	◦ The website should be responsive, ie it should adapt to the device it is accessed on (desktop vs mobile)
	◦ Most importantly: have fun!

Main Page Features:
	1. Header: A prominently styled header displaying "Mini-Games Portal" or a similar title of your choice.
	2. Navigation Bar:
	◦ Consistent across all pages, with "Home", "Games", "Contact", "Login" and "Leaderboard" selections. Only Home, Games and Contact will be functional for this iteration of the project (to be expanded on in the near future)
	◦ The "Games" tab when panned over should show a dropdown list of games available. 
	◦ Selecting a game from the dropdown takes the user directly to that game's page.
	◦ The currently selected tab should be highlighted or indicated in some way in the navigation bar.

	3. Game Thumbnails:
	◦ Display a visually appealing grid or list of game thumbnails.
	◦ Each thumbnail should have:
	▪ A representative image or icon of the game.
	▪ The game's name.
	◦ Clicking a thumbnail takes the user to the corresponding game's page.

Game Page Features:
Each game page should incorporate the following elements:

	1. Header: Display the game's name.
	2. Navigation Bar: (same as main page) 
	3. Game Description: A concise description or instructions on how to play.
	4. Game Display: The interactive section where the game plays out. Components may include:
	◦ Number Guesser: A number input, submit button, and hints.
	◦ Rock Paper Scissors: Buttons or clickable images for rock, paper, and scissors. Indicators for the computer's and player's choices.
	◦ Hangman: Display blanks for the word, a list of the alphabet for choices, and an indicator showing how many incorrect guesses have been made (eg. a hangman graphic, Xs, etc).
	◦ Blackjack: Buttons for the user to select a number, and a display of the user's and computer's final numbers.
	◦ Tic Tac Toe: A 3x3 interactive grid.

	5. Score Display:
	◦ A visible area denoting the user's current score or game status.
	◦ A visual representation of win, loss or tie.

	6. Back Arrow:
	◦ Found on each game page.
	◦ Clicking it returns the user to the main page.
 	◦ Consistently positioned across all game pages for a unified user experience.

	7. Styling:
	◦ Each game should exhibit unique styling but should also maintain a consistent theme or design with the other games and the main page.

Contact Page Features:

	1. Header: Display the page's name.
	2. Navigation Bar: (same as main page) 

	3. About: A short description of the website
	4. Input:
	◦ A contact form with a drop-down menu allowing users to select what they are contacting about (new game request vs reporting a bug).
	◦ The form should request the user for their name, email, and accept a text entry for their message.
	◦ Ensure that the name only contains alphabets and that the email is a valid email address using JavaScript validation
	◦ When the user presses "submit", the form should be replaced with a thank you message letting the user know that their request has been received. This message should include the user's name.
